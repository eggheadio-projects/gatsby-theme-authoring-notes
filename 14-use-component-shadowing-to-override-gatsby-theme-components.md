# Use Component Shadowing to Override Gatsby Theme Components

**[📹 Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/gatsby-use-component-shadowing-to-override-gatsby-theme-components)**

## Component Shadowing
We return once more to component shadowing to modify components.

This time, we plan to **change theme colors in our theme-test project**.

## Issues I Faced
Following the lesson, I ran into issues importing the theme. **These issues were fixed after following the written lesson found in the [resources](#resources) below.** The following notes pertain to the written lesson, and employ lodash.merge

## Back to the Blue Banner
In the root folder of theme-test, add src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js

Inside index.js:
```javascript
import merge from "lodash.merge"
import { theme } from "@jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-events"
export default merge({}, theme, {
 colors: {
   primary: "blue",
 },
})
```
Above, we import from lodash.merge. We will need to install this now:
```
yarn add lodash.merge
```
Restarting the dev server with
```
gatsby develop
```
Allows us to see a page with a blue header instead of a purple one.
- *"The new object exported from index.js uses lodash.merge to deeply merge the base UI theme with the theme overrides of your choice. In this case, changing the primary color to blue."*

## Override an entire component
Now, to get back on track with the video again, we will first create a folder with the same title as your theme inside src
- **With a namespaced theme, this will be two directories deep."**

For this example, we will create @jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-events
- **"Anything inside theme-test/src/@jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-events will “shadow” the components in @jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-events."**

We now create a new file to override the layout component: **theme-test/src/@jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-events/components/layout.js**

In layout.js, we add the following. I've provided what is added in both the video and in the Gatsby docs found in [resources](#resouces), as both options worked for me:

(following the video):
```javascript
import React from 'react';

export default ({ children }) => <>
{children}
<p>Added via component shadowing</p>
</>;
```
(following the Gatsby docs):
```javascript
import React from "react"

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return <>{children}</>
}
```

Restarting the dev server:
```
gatsby develop
```
Allows us to see the effect of our component shadowing.
