# Create Data Driven Pages in Gatsby with GraphQL and createPages

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/gatsby-create-data-driven-pages-in-gatsby-with-graphql-and-createpages)**

## Create pages for event previews and individual event pages

To begin our last step in gatsby-node.js, we set up the call to create the root page:
```javascript
exports.createPages = async ({ actions, graphql, reporter }) => {
  const basePath = '/';
  actions.createPage({
    path: basePath,
    component: require.resolve('.src/templates/events.js')
  });
```
The basePath defaults to the root path, and the createPage method creates a page at the basePath.

Next, we'll set it up so we can query for events.

The following will allow us to **retrieve all events, sorted by start date, in ascending order,** and will **allow us to handle the error in case the GraphQL query failed.**
```javascript
  const result = await graphql(`
    query {
      allEvent(sort: { fields: startDate, order: ASC }) {
        nodes {
          id
          slug
        }
      }
    }
  `);

  if(result.errors) {
    reporter.panic('error loading events', reporter.errors);
    return;
  }
```
Next, we'll create a page for each event by grabbing the event nodes queried from GraphQL, looping through the events, and using createPage.
```javascript
  const events = result.data.allEvent.nodes;

  events.forEach(event => {
    const slug = event.slug;

    actions.createPage({
      path: slug,
      component: require.resolve('./src/templates/event.js'),
      context: {
        eventID: event.id
      }
    });
  });
}
```
Now, we need to actually create the event.js and events.js components.

First, create src/templates/events.js within gatsby-theme-events. Within events.js:
```javascript
import React from 'react';

const EventsTemplate = () => <p>TODO build the events page</p>;

export default EventsTemplate;
```
Then, create an event.js within src/templates, and within that:
```javascript
import React from 'react';

const EventTemplate = () => <p>TODO build the events page</p>;

export default EventTemplate;
```
We can now run Gatsby in development mode:
```
yarn workspace gatsby-theme-events develop
```
And navigate to localhost:8000 to see "TODO build the events page"

We can also navigate to localhost:8000/404 to see the pages for each of our events.
