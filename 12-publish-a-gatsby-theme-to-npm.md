# Publish a Gatsby Theme to npm

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/gatsby-publish-a-gatsby-theme-to-npm)**

## Publishing our Theme
In this lesson we'll learn how to *make your Gatsby theme available for use by anyone in the community*.

We first need to **update our package.json** before publishing our theme to npm.

In gatsby-theme-events/package.json, we want to *namespace our theme* in order to keep track of who published the theme and to avoid naming collisions:
```javascript
{
  "name": "@yournpmusername/gatsby-theme-events",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  // ...
}
```
We need to now *make sure we're logged in to npm*.

In the terminal:
```
npm whoami
```
If you haven't already authorized your user for your machine, it will ask you to run
```
npm adduser
```
The terminal will now prompt you for a username, password, and email.

**For the sake of following along with the lesson, the namespace in your package.json will need to be your own.**

Change directories into the gatsby-theme-events directory:
```
cd gatsby-theme-events/
```
and publish:
```
npm publish --access public
```

Now itâ€™s published! After publishing, youâ€™ll be able to find your theme on npm at npmjs.com/{yourpackagename}
